# pyth

## About
pyth is a simple link shortener made with Python and Flask. It was made mainly as an experiment to see if I could make a link shortener, and I succeeded!

pyth is meant to be as un-intrusive as possible. Tracking features have not been added yet, but full control over your links has - you can edit or delete your links at any time (unlike many other popular link shorteners)!

## To-do

- tracking
- better UI
- accounts
