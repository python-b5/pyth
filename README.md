# pyth

## About
pyth is a simple link shortener made with Python and Flask. It was made mainly as an experiment to see if I could make a link shortener, and I succeeded!

pyth is meant to be as un-intrusive as possible. Tracking features have not been added yet, but full control over your links has - you can edit or delete your links at any time (unlike many other popular link shorteners)!

## Link
pyth is hosted live at https://www.pyth.link. Right now, it's hosted on a development server on repl.it, but I will be moving hosting to Heroku once I am satisfied that the website is done; there are still features I'd like to add (like tracking).
Try it out!
